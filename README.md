## Technologies
* wxWidgets 3.0.5

## Setup
Provided you have wxWidgets installed... 

`make all` 

...should do the rest

## Features
To-do list:
* Only thing left is the presentation of how the algorithm works specifically. So far it only shows the shortest path.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
